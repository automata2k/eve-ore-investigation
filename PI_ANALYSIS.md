# EVE Online: Planetary Interaction (PI) Market Analysis (2026)

This guide breaks down the PI P1 market based on industrial demand, price tiers, and volume in Jita. Use this to determine which extraction heads to drop for maximum "Price to Hauling" efficiency.

## 💎 The P1 Market Hierarchy

### 1. THE ROBOTICS BOTTLENECK (EXTREME DEMAND / HIGH PRICE)
*   **Materials:** Silicon, Chiral Structures, Bacteria
*   **The Why:** These are the primary inputs for **Consumer Electronics** and **Mechanical Parts**, which combine to make **Robotics**. 
*   **Significance:** Robotics are required for **ALL** player-owned structures (Upwell Citadels, Engineering Complexes, Refineries) and for almost all Tier 2 manufacturing. Silicon is also a "hard" requirement for Outpost Deployment and high-end P4 items like Broadcast Nodes.
*   **Verdict:** This is the most expensive and high-demand P1 tier. If your planet supports high-density extraction of these, prioritize them.

### 2. THE ENERGY/FUEL TIER (HIGH DEMAND / MID PRICE)
*   **Materials:** Water, Electrolytes, Oxygen
*   **The Why:** Direct inputs for **Coolant** and **Rocket Fuel**, the core components of **Structure Fuel Blocks** and Nanite Repair Paste.
*   **Significance:** Every operational Citadel, Engineering Complex, and Refinery burns Fuel Blocks every hour. The demand is infinite and steady. However, supply is also massive, keeping prices in the stable mid-range (approx. 400-600 ISK).
*   **Verdict:** The "Safe Bet." Reliable, high-volume profit. Perfect for passive income with low market risk.

### 3. THE WAR & SPEC TIER (VARIABLE DEMAND / HIGH PRICE)
*   **Materials:** Proteins, Biofuels
*   **The Why:** Used in **Ship Components**, Booster production, and high-tech P3/P4 inputs.
*   **Significance:** This is the "War Profiteering" tier. Demand spikes significantly during major server-wide conflicts when ship hull prices rise and doctrine production ramps up.
*   **Verdict:** Great "price per unit," but the market volume is thinner than the Fuel tier. You may wait longer for sell orders to clear during peace times.

### 4. THE NANO-TECH BULK (MASSIVE DEMAND / LOW PRICE)
*   **Materials:** Reactive Metals, Toxic Metals
*   **The Why:** Core inputs for Construction Blocks and **Nano-Factories** (P4). 
*   **Significance:** These are the "dirty metals" found abundantly on nearly every Barren or Lava planet. While demanded in massive numbers for P4 production, the supply is so overwhelming that the price stays at the bottom (approx. 200 ISK).
*   **Verdict:** Only worth the effort if you are moving massive "Epithal-sized" tonnage. High-volume, low-margin "grunt work."

### 5. THE "FILLER" TIER (LOW DEMAND / LOW PRICE)
*   **Materials:** Planktic Colonies, Biomass, Polyaramids
*   **The Why:** Used in niche P2 products like Fertilizer. 
*   **Significance:** These materials have limited industrial applications. EVE University notes some have "no known immediate use" without heavy further processing into obscure chains.
*   **Verdict:** Avoid extracting these unless you are supporting a very specific, specialized P3/P4 chain.

## 🍤 High-Sec Manufacturing Reality Check
*   **Importing P1 to make P2:** Generally a **loss-making strategy** in High-Sec due to the "Double-Dip Tax" (Tax on importing raw ingredients + Tax on exporting finished product).
*   **The "Golden Rule":** To make money in High-Sec PI, you must **Extract on-site**. If the P1 ingredients stay on the planet, you pay **Zero Import Tax**. 
*   **Skill Check:** Always train **Customs Code Expertise** to Level 4 or 5 to reduce the NPC portion of the tax by 40-50%.
