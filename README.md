# EVE Online: Ore Arbitrage Investigation (High Sec 2026)

## 🌌 Summary
In the current EVE Online ecosystem (Feb 2026), High Sec mining and trading have been heavily impacted by the "Mineral Scarcity" updates. Ores like **Omber**, **Kernite**, and **Jaspet** (which contain Isogen and Mexallon) are now extremely rare in belts and primarily found in **Anomalies**.

## 🚀 Best Arbitrage Situations

### 1. The "Isogen Blueprint" (Regional Hubs -> Jita)
*   **Ore Types:** Kernite, Omber, or refined Isogen.
*   **Situation:** Buy in **Dodixie** (Gallente) or **Hek** (Minmatar) where local anomaly miners and low-sec "ninjas" dump their haul far from the industrial furnace of Jita.
*   **Action:** Haul to **Jita IV - Moon 4**.
*   **Yield:** High. Isogen is currently the primary manufacturing bottleneck for T1 production.

### 2. The "Amarr Pyroxeres Pump" (Amarr Space -> Jita)
*   **Ore Type:** Pyroxeres (Compressed).
*   **Situation:** Amarr space (Domain/Tash-Murkon) is rich in **Pyroxeres**. Many miners sell uncompressed or compressed at local hubs like **Agil** or **Pasha** at a lower price than Jita.
*   **Action:** Bulk buy **Compressed Pyroxeres** (high in Mexallon/Pyerite) and haul to **Jita**.
*   **Why:** Jita's volume-based manufacturers pay a premium for "one-stop" bulk supplies.

### 3. The "Compression Play" (Missioning Systems -> Any Trade Hub)
*   **Ore Type:** Veldspar / Scordite.
*   **Situation:** Level 4 Mission systems like **Osmon** or **Langisi** have a surplus of "junk ore" from miners cleaning out mission pockets or local belts.
*   **Action:** Buy uncompressed ore at low price, dock at a local player structure with **Reprocessing/Compression**, compress it (volume reduction ~100x), and haul to the nearest hub.

## 🍤 Shrimp's Tip
Don't haul uncompressed ore. The fuel and risk significantly outweigh the profit. **Compressed Isogen-rich ores** are the current "Gold Coast" of High Sec trading.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: High Sec Mining Nuances (2026)

### 1. The "Ghost belts" and Mining Escalations
With the **Equinox** and **Catalyst** updates, standard asteroid belts in High Sec have been reduced. However, finishing a "standard" belt now has a small chance to trigger a **Mining Escalation**. 
*   **Target:** These sites are essentially "hidden nodes" of massive ore volume.
*   **Strategy:** Speed-clearing "bad" belts (like Scordite/Veldspar) in an Orca-boosted fleet to force the escalation spawn. The escalation site is significantly more ISK/hour than standard mining.

### 2. Moon Mining vs. Belt Mining
High Sec Moons only provide **R4 (Ubiquitous) ores** (Zeolite, Bitumen, etc.). 
*   **Arbitrage:** High Sec moons are actually a source of **Pyerite** and **Mexallon** surplus. 
*   **The Play:** Don't mine these for pure ISK; mine them if you are a manufacturer in **Caldari** or **Amarr** space to bypass the trade hub tax. Local buy orders for raw moon ore in quiet backwater systems are often 15-20% below Jita price.

### 3. Regional "Scarcity" Spikes
*   **Minmatar Space (Metropolis/Heimatar):** Often short on **Mexallon**. Buying Pyroxeres in Amarr and selling in **Hek** or **Rens** can sometimes yield a higher % margin than Jita, albeit at lower volume.
*   **Caldari Space (The Forge/Lonetrek):** Oversaturated with Veldspar. Moving high-end High Sec ores (like anomaly-mined **Jaspet**) from Gallente space into **Jita** remains the most reliable large-volume play.

### 🦐 Advanced Arbitrage: "The Blueprint Bridge"
Instead of hauling ore, check the price of **T1 Industry Blueprints** in student/starter systems. Occasionally, items like **Mining Laser I** or standard **Ammo** BPOs are sold at NPC fixed prices (100k - 500k) but trade at a 5-10% premium in Jita due to buy-order convenience. It's low-volume, but literally zero risk (standard shuttle haul).
