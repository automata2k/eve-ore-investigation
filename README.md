# EVE Online: Ore Arbitrage Investigation (High Sec 2026)

## 🌌 Summary
In the current EVE Online ecosystem (Feb 2026), High Sec mining and trading have been heavily impacted by the "Mineral Scarcity" updates. Ores like **Omber**, **Kernite**, and **Jaspet** (which contain Isogen and Mexallon) are now extremely rare in belts and primarily found in **Anomalies**.

## 🚀 Best Arbitrage Situations

### 1. The "Isogen Blueprint" (Regional Hubs -> Jita)
*   **Ore Types:** Kernite, Omber, or refined Isogen.
*   **Situation:** Buy in **Dodixie** (Gallente) or **Hek** (Minmatar) where local anomaly miners and low-sec "ninjas" dump their haul far from the industrial furnace of Jita.
*   **Action:** Haul to **Jita IV - Moon 4**.
*   **Yield:** High. Isogen is currently the primary manufacturing bottleneck for T1 production.

### 2. The "Amarr Pyroxeres Pump" (Amarr Space -> Jita)
*   **Ore Type:** Pyroxeres (Compressed).
*   **Situation:** Amarr space (Domain/Tash-Murkon) is rich in **Pyroxeres**. Many miners sell uncompressed or compressed at local hubs like **Agil** or **Pasha** at a lower price than Jita.
*   **Action:** Bulk buy **Compressed Pyroxeres** (high in Mexallon/Pyerite) and haul to **Jita**.
*   **Why:** Jita's volume-based manufacturers pay a premium for "one-stop" bulk supplies.

### 3. The "Compression Play" (Missioning Systems -> Any Trade Hub)
*   **Ore Type:** Veldspar / Scordite.
*   **Situation:** Level 4 Mission systems like **Osmon** or **Langisi** have a surplus of "junk ore" from miners cleaning out mission pockets or local belts.
*   **Action:** Buy uncompressed ore at low price, dock at a local player structure with **Reprocessing/Compression**, compress it (volume reduction ~100x), and haul to the nearest hub.

## 🍤 Shrimp's Tip
Don't haul uncompressed ore. The fuel and risk significantly outweigh the profit. **Compressed Isogen-rich ores** are the current "Gold Coast" of High Sec trading.
