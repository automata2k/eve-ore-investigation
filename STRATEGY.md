# EVE Online: Starter Arbitrage Strategy (2026)

## 📍 Where to Start: The "Isogen Blueprint"
If you and Tom want the best "bang for your buck" starting today, I recommend the **Regional-to-Jita Haul** focusing on **Isogen-rich materials**.

---

### Step 1: The "Galente Gather" (Low Risk)
*   **Location:** **Dodixie** (Sinq Laison) or nearby Gallente starter systems.
*   **The Play:** Look for local sell orders of **Kernite**, **Omber**, or **Jaspet** (Compressed or Raw).
*   **Action:** Buy in Dodixie and haul to **Jita IV - Moon 4**.
*   **Profit Driver:** The price of Isogen is much higher in Jita due to the massive ship-building factories there. Regional Gallente miners often dump their anomaly finds locally for quick cash.

### Step 2: The "Amarr Pyroxeres Pipeline" (Quantity Play)
*   **Location:** **Amarr** (Domain) hub or backwater systems in **Tash-Murkon**.
*   **The Play:** Source **Compressed Pyroxeres**.
*   **Action:** This ore is high in **Mexallon** and **Pyerite**. Haul from Amarr space to **Jita**.
*   **Profit Driver:** Jita's manufacturing index is so high that manufacturers burn through millions of units of Pyerite daily. They will pay a premium for bulk compressed delivery.

### Step 3: Manufacturing for Missioners (The "Long Play")
Once you have some ISK, stop hauling to Jita and become the **Local Boss**.
*   **Location:** **Osmon** (The Forge) - A massive Level 4 mission hub for Sisters of EVE.
*   **The Play:** Manufacture **Scourge Heavy Missiles** or **Hobgoblin I** drones.
*   **Action:** Transport your sourced minerals from steps 1 & 2 to a player-owned Engineering Complex (Raitaru) in a system **1 jump away** from Osmon (to avoid high hub taxes). Sell in Osmon at a markup.
*   **Profit Driver:** Missioners are lazy. They will pay 10-15% more for ammo in their home system than they would if they had to fly to Jita.

## 💎 The Refining Problem: Why is my yield so low?
If you have **Perfect Reprocessing Skills** (Reprocessing V, Efficiency V, Specific Ore V) but are seeing yields around **41%**, you are being robbed by NPC bureaucracy.

### 1. The NPC Station Trap
*   **Base Yield:** NPC Stations (like the *Iskuhone Corporation Factory* in Korama) have an inherently low base yield, typically **50%**.
*   **Unrecoverable Tax:** NPC stations take a "cut" of your minerals that cannot be avoided by skills (only by corporate standings, and only partially).
*   **Calculated Yield:** 50% base * Skills (1.15 * 1.10 * 1.10) = ~72%. If you see 41%, there is either a Massive Corp Tax or you are refining Ore that you don't have the "Advanced" skill for.

### 2. The Solution: Upwell Structures (Athanors / Tataras)
In 2026, you **must** use player-owned refineries for any serious operation.
*   **Athanor Base:** 54% (Before skills/rigs).
*   **Rigs:** Player structures can be fitted with **Reprocessing Rigs** (T1 or T2).
*   **Location Bonus:** Rigs in High Sec are good; in Low/Null, they are insane.
*   **Comparison:**
    *   *NPC Station:* ~50-70% max.
    *   *Athanor (T1 Rigged):* ~71-75%.
    *   *Athanor (T2 Rigged):* ~76-80%+.

**Action Item:** Search the Neocom (Structure Browser) in Korama or nearby systems like **Hakonen** or **Perimeter** for a public Athanor with "Reprocessing" listed. Look for **0% or 1% Tax**. Your yield will jump from 41% to ~75%+ instantly.

## 🏭 Manufacturing Efficiency: Raitaru vs. NPC Station
Just like with refining, manufacturing in an NPC station (like the *Iskuhone Corporation Factory*) is a waste of ISK.

### 1. The Numbers (High-Sec)
| Benefit | NPC Station | Raitaru (EC) | Rigged Raitaru |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material Efficiency (ME)** | 0% | **1.0%** | **~3.2%** |
| **Time Efficiency (TE)** | 0% | **15.0%** | **~35.0%** |
| **Cost Reduction** | 0% | **3.0%** | **3.0%** |

### 2. Why it matters
*   **ME (Materials):** Saving 1-3% on materials sounds small, but in industry, your profit margin *is* the small numbers. If you are building 50 million rounds of Antimatter M, a 3% saving in Tritanium is millions of ISK in pure profit.
*   **TE (Time):** Being 15-35% faster means you can cycle your production slots more often. More batches = more ISK/hour.
*   **Cost:** Engineering Complexes have a lower base cost for "installing" the job, making it cheaper to start production.

**Action Item:** In Korama, find a private **Raitaru** or **Azbel**. Check the structure info to ensure it has **"Manufacturing"** enabled. Look for structures with **0% or 1% tax**. Using a player structure is essentially like getting a free level in every industry skill.

## 🚀 Recommended Route Summary

| Activity | Start System | End System | Item to Haul | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Newbie Run** | **Starter Systems** | **Jita** | Shuttles / T1 BPOs | Zero |
| **Bulk Haul** | **Amarr** | **Jita** | Compressed Pyroxeres | Low |

## 🍤 Shrimp's Location Cheat Sheet
*   **Jita IV - Moon 4:** The Center of the Universe. Sell everything here.
*   **Perimeter:** Check player structures for 0% tax refining/manufacturing.
*   **Osmon / Apanake:** High-volume mission systems for selling finished goods.

## 🎯 Combat Strategy: Tracking and Transversal 101
If you find your guns are missing even when the enemy is in range, you are losing the "Math War" against Transversal Velocity.

### 1. The Definitions (The "Why am I missing?" part)
*   **Tracking Speed:** How fast your gun can swivel. Small guns swivel fast; big guns (like your 150mm/200mm Rails) swivel like a rusty gate.
*   **Signature Resolution:** The size of the "bullet" your gun fires. Medium guns fire a "resolution" of 125mm. Frigates have a "signature" of ~35mm. It's like trying to hit a fly with a bowling ball.
*   **Transversal Velocity:** How fast the target is moving *across* your screen (sideways). High transversal = your guns can't swivel fast enough to keep up.

### 2. The Solution: Managing Transversal
You cannot change your gun's tracking much, but you CAN change the enemy's transversal by changing how you fly.

#### **The "Tail-Chase" Maneuver**
If a pack of Guristas frigates is orbiting you at 5km, they have **Maximum Transversal**. Your tracking will fail.
1.  **Stop Orbiting them.**
2.  **Pick a point in space (a celestial or a bookmark) and "Align To" it.**
3.  **Turn on your Afterburner.**
4.  As you move away, the frigates will stop circling and start flying in a straight line directly behind you to catch up.
5.  **Result:** Their Transversal Velocity drops to **ZERO**. Even a massive Battleship gun can hit a frigate if it's flying directly towards or away from the barrel.

### 3. Vexor-Specific Efficiency
*   **The Target Painter:** Use this! It "bloats" the enemy's Signature Radius. If you paint a 35mm frigate up to 50mm, your medium railguns "see" it as a much larger target, and your hit chance skyrockets.
*   **The Drone "Anvil":** Think of your Vexor as the Anvil and your Drones as the Hammer. Use your Rails to "snack" on targets that are flying straight at you, but let your **Hobgoblins** kill anything that is orbiting you too fast to track.
*   **Dual 150mm vs 200mm:** The 150mms track better, but they still have the 125mm Signature Resolution. They are "better," but they aren't a magic fix for poor piloting.

**Shrimp's Golden Rule:** If you miss more than two shots in a row, you are flying wrong. Change your alignment, drop your transversal, and watch the wreck indicators pop.
