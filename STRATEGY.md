# EVE Online: Starter Arbitrage Strategy (2026)

## 📍 Where to Start: The "Isogen Blueprint"
If you and Tom want the best "bang for your buck" starting today, I recommend the **Regional-to-Jita Haul** focusing on **Isogen-rich materials**.

---

### Step 1: The "Galente Gather" (Low Risk)
*   **Location:** **Dodixie** (Sinq Laison) or nearby Gallente starter systems.
*   **The Play:** Look for local sell orders of **Kernite**, **Omber**, or **Jaspet** (Compressed or Raw).
*   **Action:** Buy in Dodixie and haul to **Jita IV - Moon 4**.
*   **Profit Driver:** The price of Isogen is much higher in Jita due to the massive ship-building factories there. Regional Gallente miners often dump their anomaly finds locally for quick cash.

### Step 2: The "Amarr Pyroxeres Pipeline" (Quantity Play)
*   **Location:** **Amarr** (Domain) hub or backwater systems in **Tash-Murkon**.
*   **The Play:** Source **Compressed Pyroxeres**.
*   **Action:** This ore is high in **Mexallon** and **Pyerite**. Haul from Amarr space to **Jita**.
*   **Profit Driver:** Jita's manufacturing index is so high that manufacturers burn through millions of units of Pyerite daily. They will pay a premium for bulk compressed delivery.

### Step 3: Manufacturing for Missioners (The "Long Play")
Once you have some ISK, stop hauling to Jita and become the **Local Boss**.
*   **Location:** **Osmon** (The Forge) - A massive Level 4 mission hub for Sisters of EVE.
*   **The Play:** Manufacture **Scourge Heavy Missiles** or **Hobgoblin I** drones.
*   **Action:** Transport your sourced minerals from steps 1 & 2 to a player-owned Engineering Complex (Raitaru) in a system **1 jump away** from Osmon (to avoid high hub taxes). Sell in Osmon at a markup.
*   **Profit Driver:** Missioners are lazy. They will pay 10-15% more for ammo in their home system than they would if they had to fly to Jita.

## 🍤 Shrimp's Location Cheat Sheet
*   **Jita IV - Moon 4:** The Center of the Universe. Sell everything here.
*   **Perimeter:** Check player structures for 0% tax refining/manufacturing.
*   **Osmon / Apanake:** High-volume mission systems for selling finished goods.
*   **Ashab:** A great "bridge" system between Amarr and Caldari space for mid-way storage.
