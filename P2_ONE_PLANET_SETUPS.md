# EVE Online: Single-Planet P2 Manufacturing Setups

To make a profit in High-Sec PI, you must use the **"Zero-Import"** strategy. This means extracting all P1 ingredients and manufacturing the P2 on a single planet to avoid the soul-crushing import taxes.

Here are the two best starting "tests" for a self-sufficient P2 planet.

## 🏗️ Option 1: Coolant (The "Old Reliable" Fuel Play)
*   **Planet Type:** Gas or Storm
*   **Ingredients:** Water (Aqueous Liquids) + Electrolytes (Ionic Solutions)
*   **Target Market:** Fuel Tier (Extreme stability)

### Why this is a great test:
Coolant is the "bread and butter" of PI. Every player-owned structure burns it 24/7 to stay online. It is high-volume, easy to sell in Jita, and Gas planets are abundant in High-Sec.

### 📐 Technical Layout:
*   **Command Center:** Level IV+
*   **Extraction:** 
    *   1x Extractor (Aqueous Liquids)
    *   1x Extractor (Ionic Solutions)
*   **Processing:**
    *   2x Basic Industry Facilities (yielding Water)
    *   2x Basic Industry Facilities (yielding Electrolytes)
    *   1x Advanced Industry Facility (yielding Coolant)
*   **Buffer:** 1x Launchpad (Storage). Route: Extractors -> Launchpad -> Basic -> Advanced -> Launchpad.

## 💎 Option 2: Miniature Electronics (The "High Value" Robotics Play)
*   **Planet Type:** Lava
*   **Ingredients:** Silicon (Felsic Magma) + Chiral Structures (Non-CS Crystals)
*   **Target Market:** Robotics Tier (Highest demand/price)

### Why this is a great next step:
If you want to move from "stable" to "lucrative," you move into the Robotics chain. Miniature Electronics are a core ingredient for Robotics and high-end Planetary Vehicles. Silicon and Chiral Structures are both "King Tier" P1 materials with much higher unit prices than Water.

### 📐 Technical Layout:
*   **Command Center:** Level IV+ (Note: Lava planets have high radius, so links are expensive. Cluster your buildings tight!)
*   **Extraction:**
    *   1x Extractor (Felsic Magma) 
    *   1x Extractor (Non-CS Crystals)
*   **Processing:**
    *   2x Basic Industry Facilities (yielding Silicon)
    *   2x Basic Industry Facilities (yielding Chiral Structures)
    *   1x Advanced Industry Facility (yielding Miniature Electronics)
*   **Constraint:** Lava planets are "hot" and large. Keep your factory cluster as close to the pole as possible to minimize link length and save on Power/CPU.

## 🍤 Shrimp’s Setup Philosophy:
1.  **23-Hour Cycles:** In High-Sec, don't use long cycles. Reset your extractors daily to keep the intake high enough to feed your factories.
2.  **The "Launchpad Hub":** Never route extractors directly to factories. If the extractor stops, the factory jams. Route EVERYTHING through the Launchpad as a buffer.
3.  **Taxes:** At 11% tax, these setups will still make you approx. 50M+ ISK per month, per planet, purely from "zero-cost" extraction.
