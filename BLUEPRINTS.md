# EVE Online: Blueprint & Manufacturing Investigation (High Sec 2026)

## 🏗️ The High Sec Manufacturing Reality
In 2026, manufacturing T1 items in High Sec is a game of **efficiency and location**. Without the massive bonuses of Null Sec Sotiyos, your profit comes from **buying materials at regional lows** and **selling finished goods at local mission peaks**.

## 💰 Top Profit Blueprints (T1 BPOs)

| Blueprint Type | Item Examples | Profit Driver | Ideal Sales Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fuel Blocks** | Ametat, Helion, Nitrogen | Constant demand for structures | Industrial hubs (Perimeter) |
| **T1 Rigs (Small)** | Anti-EM Screen, Core Defense | Salvage is cheap/abundant | Any trade hub |
| **Consumables** | Scourge Heavy Missiles, Drones | High volume turnover | Mission Hubs (Osmon, Apanake) |
| **Support Modules** | Damage Controls, Cap Batteries | Essential for every fit | Backwater hubs (Hek, Rens) |
| **Shuttles** | Gallente Shuttle, Caldari Shuttle | High loss rate = high turnover | Starter systems / Hubs |

## 🚀 The "Mission Hub" Strategy (Arbitrage Manufacturing)
The best ROI in High Sec isn't manufacturing for Jita; it's manufacturing **for the people running Level 4 missions**.

### 1. The Play
Identify the ammo and drones used in a specific mission hub.
*   **Example (Osmon):** Missioners there fight Guristas. They need **Kinetic damage** (Scourge Missiles / Hybrid Railgun charges) and **Thermal/Kinetic defense**.
*   **The Blueprint:** Buy the BPOs for these items, research them to **ME 10 / TE 20**, and setup a production line in a nearby Raitaru.

### 2. The Margin Fix
Don't buy your minerals in Jita. Use the **Ore Arbitrage** techniques from the main README. 
*   Mine or buy raw ore in regional pockets.
*   Refine locally to get your Tritanium and Pyerite.
*   Your "Mineral Cost" will be ~10-15% lower than your competitors buying in Jita.

## 🛠️ Required Infrastructure
To compete in High Sec, you **must** use a player-owned Engineering Complex:

| Structure | Best For | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raitaru** | Small/Medium production | Standard efficiency bonus (Base: 1% ME, 15% TE) |
| **Azbel** | Large-scale production | Higher efficiency and rig bonuses |
| **Public ECs** | Low volume | Find public complexes in **Perimeter** or **Ashab** with 0% tax. |

## 🍤 Shrimp's Pro Tips
1.  **Don't overproduce:** Markets in mission hubs are shallow. 50,000 rounds of ammo might sell in a day; 5,000,000 will crash the local price.
2.  **Watch the "Job Installation" tax:** If the System Manufacuring Cost Index is >5%, move your production one or two jumps away.
3.  **BPO over BPC:** For T1 items, always buy the BPO. The research time is an investment that turns into pure passive potential.
