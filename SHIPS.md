# EVE Online Ship Comparison: Gnosis vs. Drake vs. Praxis

This research was conducted to evaluate ship performance for DED sites (High/Low-sec) and J-Space (Wormhole) ratting.

## Executive Summary

| **Primary Use** | DED 1/10 - 4/10 | DED 5/10 / C2 WH | C3 WH Solo |
| **Tank Type** | Active/Passive Shield | Passive "Brick" | Massive Passive Shield |
| **Weapon Bonus** | 50% All (Role) | 50% Kinetic (Skill) | 25% All (Role) |
| **Drone Strength** | High (Med Drones) | Low (Light Drones) | Extreme (Sentries/Heavies) |
| **Est. ISK/hr** | 40 - 60M (DED) | 30 - 50M (C2) | 120 - 180M (C3) |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Very Low | High (Large Signature) |

## 1. DED Site Efficiency
*   **Gnosis:** Best for 3/10 and 4/10. Its universal damage bonus allowing it to target enemy resist holes (e.g., Thermal for Guristas) makes it faster than the Drake.
*   **Drake:** The gold standard for 5/10s. Its passive shield recharge and kinetic lock align perfectly with Guristas/Serpentis sites. It is "un-killable" by most DED bosses.

## 2. J-Space (Wormhole) Analysis

### The ISK/Hour Breakdown
Calculations based on average clear times and blue loot value.

*   **Drake (C2):** 
    *   *Site Clear Time:* 12-15 mins.
    *   *Blue Loot:* ~8-12M per site.
    *   *Total:* ~40M ISK/hr.
*   **Praxis (C3):**
    *   *Site Clear Time:* 15-20 mins (Fortified Frontier Stronghold).
    *   *Blue Loot:* ~45M per site.
    *   *Total:* ~135M ISK/hr.

### Survival & The "Proteus" Factor
The Proteus is a player-controlled Strategic Cruiser. It uses Covert Ops cloaks to stalk prey. 
*   **Drake:** Harder to catch (medium signature), but slow to warp.
*   **Praxis:** Massive target. If a hunter enters the hole, you are the first thing they see on D-Scan. Always run with a Core Probe Launcher fitted to ensure you can find a backup exit.

## 3. Recommended Fits

### C3 Solo Praxis
