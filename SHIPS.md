# EVE Online Ship Comparison: Gnosis vs. Drake vs. Praxis

This research was conducted to evaluate ship performance for DED sites (High/Low-sec) and J-Space (Wormhole) ratting.

## Executive Summary

| Stat | Gnosis | Drake | Praxis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use** | DED 1/10 - 4/10 | DED 5/10 / C2 WH | C3 WH Solo |
| **Tank Type** | Active/Passive Shield | Passive "Brick" | Massive Passive Shield |
| **Weapon Bonus** | 50% All (Role) | 50% Kinetic (Skill) | 25% All (Role) |
| **Drone Strength** | High (Med Drones) | Low (Light Drones) | Extreme (Sentries/Heavies) |
| **Est. ISK/hr** | 40 - 60M (DED) | 30 - 50M (C2) | 120 - 180M (C3) |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Very Low | High (Large Signature) |

## 1. DED Site Efficiency
*   **Gnosis:** Best for 3/10 and 4/10. Its universal damage bonus allowing it to target enemy resist holes (e.g., Thermal for Guristas) makes it faster than the Drake.
*   **Drake:** The gold standard for 5/10s. Its passive shield recharge and kinetic lock align perfectly with Guristas/Serpentis sites. It is "un-killable" by most DED bosses.

## 2. J-Space (Wormhole) Analysis

### The ISK/Hour Breakdown
Calculations based on average clear times and blue loot value.

*   **Drake (C2):** 
    *   *Site Clear Time:* 12-15 mins.
    *   *Blue Loot:* ~8-12M per site.
    *   *Total:* ~40M ISK/hr.
*   **Praxis (C3):**
    *   *Site Clear Time:* 15-20 mins (Fortified Frontier Stronghold).
    *   *Blue Loot:* ~45M per site.
    *   *Total:* ~135M ISK/hr.

### Survival & The "Proteus" Factor
The Proteus is a player-controlled Strategic Cruiser. It uses Covert Ops cloaks to stalk prey. 
*   **Drake:** Harder to catch (medium signature), but slow to warp.
*   **Praxis:** Massive target. If a hunter enters the hole, you are the first thing they see on D-Scan. Always run with a Core Probe Launcher fitted to ensure you can find a backup exit.

## 3. Recommended Fits

### C2/DED 5/10 Passive Drake
*   **Highs:** 6x Heavy Missile Launcher II (Scourge), 1x Core Probe Launcher I.
*   **Mids:** 2x Large Shield Extender II, 1x Multispectrum Shield Hardener, 2x Shield Recharger II, 1x 10MN Afterburner.
*   **Lows:** 2x Ballistic Control System II, 2x Shield Power Relay II.
*   **Rigs:** 3x Medium Core Defense Field Purger I.

## 🛡️ Case Study: The "apider Drake E4" Refinement
A breakdown of the Guristas DED 4/10 Drake fit.

### 1. The Current "E4" Fit Critique
The E4 is a "Hybrid Active" build. While it works, it has an **Identity Crisis**:
*   **The Tank:** Combining a *Medium Shield Booster* with a *Large Shield Extender* is inefficient. Because passive shield recharge is based on a percentage of your total shield pool, adding more HP (Extenders) directly boosts your "natural" healing. 
*   **The Weapon:** Heavy Assault Missiles (HAMs) have amazing DPS, but a Drake moves like a planet. You will spend 70% of the site just slow-boating toward targets at 20km.

### 2. Suggested Improvement: The "Passive Sniper" Drake
This version swaps the active booster for more "passive" regen and swaps HAMs for Heavies (HML) to clear the field from the warp-in point.

**The Refined Fit:**
*   **Highs:** 6x Heavy Missile Launcher II (Scourge Fury/Faction).
*   **Mids:** 3x Large Shield Extender II, 1x 10MN Afterburner II, 1x Multispectrum Shield Hardener II, 1x Kinetic Shield Hardener II.
*   **Lows:** 3x Ballistic Control System II, 1x Damage Control II.
*   **Rigs:** 3x **Medium Core Defense Field Purger I/II**.

### 3. Why this is better for Guristas 4/10:
1.  **Zero-Cap Tank:** You can stay on the field even if your capacitor is empty.
2.  **Range:** You can hit targets at 50-70km. Total time to clear the site drops because you don't have to fly to every target.
3.  **The "Passive" Math:** With 3x Purger rigs and 3x Extenders, your shield will naturally regenerate ~150-200 HP per second. This is more than enough to tank a Guristas 4/10 without ever clicking a button.
