# Pochven: The Triglavian Wild West
A guide to survival and profit in the occupied systems of the Triglavian Collective.

## 1. Standings & NPC Relations
The Triglavian Collective and EDENCOM view capsuleers based on their standing. Achieving a positive standing (at least +0.01) is the first step to safe travel.

*   **NPC Neutrality:** With positive standing (+0.01 or higher), Triglavian NPCs in K-space and Pochven become neutral. They will no longer attack on sight at gates or wormholes.
*   **Gate Access:**
    *   **0.01 Standing:** Allows use of Border and Internal conduit gates.
    *   **6.0 - 7.0 Standing:** Required for "Home" system conduit gates (e.g., Ichoriya, Niarja).
*   **Station Services:** Standing above -0.05 is required to dock and use repair/fitting services in Triglavian stations.
*   **The "Double Positive":** By participating in battles against Rogue Drones, Sleepers, or Drifters *within* Pochven, pilots can earn standing for both Triglavians and EDENCOM simultaneously.

## 2. Navigating the Region
Pochven is a unique Null-Sec region with "Grid-less" intelligence.

*   **No Local List:** Players do not appear in the Local chat list unless they speak. Constant use of the Directional Scanner (D-Scan) is mandatory.
*   **Filaments:** The primary way in and out.
    *   **Inbound (Entry):** Border, Internal, and Home filaments drop fleets into specific tiers of systems.
    *   **Outbound (Exit):**
        *   **Proximal (Extraction):** Returns the fleet to a random system near the entry point.
        *   **Glorification (Devana):** Targets High-Sec or Low-Sec regions for a safe return home.
*   **Operational Rules:**
    *   **15-Minute Rule:** You cannot use an outbound filament for 15 minutes after using an inbound one.
    *   **1,000km Rule:** You must be 1,000km away from any structure or celestial to activate a filament.

## 3. ISK-Making Opportunities
Pochven offers high-risk, high-reward activities for solo pilots and fleets.

*   **Scavenging (Low/Medium Risk):** Following NPC battles (Trigs vs. Drifters/Sleepers) and salvaging the wrecks. Drifter battleship salvage is exceptionally valuable.
*   **Ninja Mining:** Extraction of unique ores (Beivittium, Ducaneer, Mordunium, Talassite) found only in Pochven. Best performed in cloaky frigates.
*   **Rogue Drone Hunting:** Clearing drone anomalies for valuable construction components like Enhanced Electro-Neural Signallers.
*   **Observatory Flashpoints (Fleet):** High-end coordinated combat yielding hundreds of millions of ISK per run, often contested by major player alliances.
*   **Market Arbitrage:** Importing high-demand consumables (ammo, nanite paste, fuel) into station-poor systems.

## 4. Ship Selection & Survival
Stealth and speed are the primary defenses in Pochven.

*   **Covert Ops Cloak:** Essential for invisible transitions and avoiding combat probes.
*   **Target Ships:**
    *   **Anathema (Amarr):** Recommended for its 3 High slots (Cloak, Probes, Salvager) and 4 Low slots (high agility/sub-2s align).
    *   **Prospect (ORE):** The premier ninja-miner with a Covert Ops cloak.
    *   **Buzzard (Caldari):** Superior for hacking sites due to its 5 Mid slots.
*   **The "Sub-2-Second" Rule:** Fitting for an align time under 2 seconds makes a ship nearly impossible to catch in gate-to-gate travel.
