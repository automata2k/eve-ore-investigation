# Pochven: The Triglavian Wild West
A guide to survival and profit in the occupied systems of the Triglavian Collective.

## 1. Standings & NPC Relations
The Triglavian Collective and EDENCOM view capsuleers based on their standing. Achieving a positive standing (at least +0.01) is the first step to safe travel.

*   **NPC Neutrality:** With positive standing (+0.01 or higher), Triglavian NPCs in K-space and Pochven become neutral. They will no longer attack on sight at gates or wormholes.
*   **Gate Access:**
    *   **0.01 Standing:** Allows use of Border and Internal conduit gates.
    *   **6.0 - 7.0 Standing:** Required for "Home" system conduit gates (e.g., Ichoriya, Niarja).
*   **Station Services:** Standing above -0.05 is required to dock and use repair/fitting services in Triglavian stations.
*   **The "Double Positive":** By participating in battles against Rogue Drones, Sleepers, or Drifters *within* Pochven, pilots can earn standing for both Triglavians and EDENCOM simultaneously.

## 2. Navigating the Region
Pochven is a unique Null-Sec region with "Grid-less" intelligence.

*   **No Local List:** Players do not appear in the Local chat list unless they speak. Constant use of the Directional Scanner (D-Scan) is mandatory.
*   **Filaments:** The primary way in and out.
    *   **Inbound (Entry):** Border, Internal, and Home filaments drop fleets into specific tiers of systems.
    *   **Outbound (Exit):**
        *   **Proximal (Extraction):** Returns the fleet to a random system near the entry point.
        *   **Glorification (Devana):** Targets High-Sec or Low-Sec regions for a safe return home.
*   **Operational Rules:**
    *   **15-Minute Rule:** You cannot use an outbound filament for 15 minutes after using an inbound one.
    *   **1,000km Rule:** You must be 1,000km away from any structure or celestial to activate a filament.

## 3. ISK-Making Opportunities
Pochven offers high-risk, high-reward activities for solo pilots and fleets.

*   **Scavenging (Low/Medium Risk):** Following NPC battles (Trigs vs. Drifters/Sleepers) and salvaging the wrecks. Drifter battleship salvage is exceptionally valuable.
*   **Ninja Mining:** Extraction of unique ores (Beivittium, Ducaneer, Mordunium, Talassite) found only in Pochven. Best performed in cloaky frigates.
*   **Rogue Drone Hunting:** Clearing drone anomalies for valuable construction components like Enhanced Electro-Neural Signallers.
*   **Observatory Flashpoints (Fleet):** High-end coordinated combat yielding hundreds of millions of ISK per run, often contested by major player alliances.
*   **Market Arbitrage:** Importing high-demand consumables (ammo, nanite paste, fuel) into station-poor systems.

## 4. Ship Selection & Survival
Stealth and speed are the primary defenses in Pochven.

*   **Covert Ops Cloak:** Essential for invisible transitions and avoiding combat probes.
*   **Target Ships:**
    *   **Anathema (Amarr):** The "Runner." Features 3 High slots (Cloak, Probes, Salvager) and 4 Low slots (best in class). Designed for high agility and sub-2s align times, making it the hardest CovOps frigate to catch.
    *   **Buzzard (Caldari):** The "Hacker." Features 3 High slots and 5 Mid slots (best in class). Superior for scanning accuracy and running specialized Data/Relic sites, though slower to align than the Anathema.
    *   **Prospect (ORE):** The premier ninja-miner with a Covert Ops cloak.
*   **The "Sub-2-Second" Rule:** Fitting for an align time under 2 seconds makes a ship nearly impossible to catch in gate-to-gate travel.

## 5. Specialized Ship Roles
While Covert Ops frigates are the baseline, other hulls offer specialized benefits for the Pochven environment.

### 5.1 The "Space Janitor" (Scavenging)
*   **Sunesis:** The go-to ship for low-cost salvaging.
    *   **Motivation:** It features a sub-2s align time out of the box, decent cargo space for high-value salvage, and enough low slots for staying power. It is extremely cheap to replace when the "Wild West" gets too wild.

### 5.2 The Combat Explorer
*   **Astero:** The predator of the frigate class.
    *   **Motivation:** Combines a Covert Ops cloak with a powerful drone bay. It can run Data/Relic sites and still hunt or defend against other explorers.

### 5.3 The Jack-of-All-Trades
*   **T3 Cruisers (Tengu, Loki):**
    *   **Motivation:** With the "Interdiction Nullifier" and "Covert Reconfiguration" subsystems, these are the kings of the region. They can jump through bubbles, warp cloaked, and have the tank to survive inadvertent NPC aggression.

### 5.4 High-End Fleet Combat
*   **Marauders (Vargur, Paladin, Golem, Kronos):**
    *   **Motivation:** Essential for high-payout sites like **Observatory Flashpoints**. Their Bastion module allows them to tank massive NPC damage, though they are vulnerable to player "drops" while immobile.

### 5.5 Stealth Logistics
*   **Blockade Runners (Viator, Prowler, Crane, Prudence):**
    *   **Motivation:** The only way to safely move fuel and ammo into the region. They can warp cloaked and are immune to cargo scanners, making them the lifeblood of Triglavian-based operations.

### 5.6 Specialized Mining
*   **Endurance:** The alternative to the Prospect.
    *   **Motivation:** While it lacks a Covert Ops cloak, it features a massive ore hold and high speed. Useful for "Orca-boosted" fleets or high-volume extraction where the Prospect's hold is too small.

## 6. Comparison: Pochven vs. Wormholes
While both share the lack of a Local chat list, the environment and survival strategies differ.

*   **Hostility (Pochven: High | Wormholes: Low to Medium):**
    *   **Wormholes:** A "Quiet Hostility." Ambushes are rare but lethal. NPCs (Sleepers) stay in static signature sites.
    *   **Pochven:** A "War Zone." NPCs (Triglavians, Drifters, Sleepers) are dynamic and will roam to celestial bodies and gates. You will encounter other players more frequently due to the region's small size.
*   **Difficulty (Pochven: High | Wormholes: Scaled):**
    *   **Wormholes:** Difficulty is tiered by class (C1-C6). Sleeper AI is predictable and follows older, static patterns.
    *   **Pochven:** All content uses modern, reactive AI which includes focus-firing drones, warping away for reinforcements, and advanced fleet tactics.
*   **Logistics & Extraction:**
    *   **Wormholes:** High stress. If your hole collapses, you are stranded until you probe a new exit.
    *   **Pochven:** Medium stress. As long as you have a Devana/Extraction filament and wait out your 15-minute timer, you can leave for regular space at any time.
